<A NAME="0000">What compatibility specifications does the website define?</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>All code on this website is supported by the HTML 3.2 specifications. Some pages need only HTML 2.0 support, but because most pages use tables to organize archived save files in a database format, usually HTML 3.2 support will be needed. No colors except black, gray, silver, white, and colors assigned to hyperlinks (typically blue and purple) are used in the website content (exclusive of non-text binary accessed using the website). There is no specified boundary as to how wide the tables for save files can be, so if the website is viewed on a monitor with a low screen resolution, contents of table rows may wrap to a new line on the web page.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="0001">Why not add a theme and effects to the website?</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The website was created for the purpose of data organization with adherence to compatibility and readability, but it is likely that it will become more advanced later as popularity increases. If you, the reader, would like to design a template or theme for the website to use, find a way to contact one of its managers for directory space to store information about the design you would like to propose.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="0010">Who manages this site?</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The greatest of managers is everyone with a video-gaming passion who is willing to at least communicate their history with video games. As the next question will discuss, one such group of people had to eventually form and organize such information in the form of an archive of save files for video games within that history. The active members of this group that have direct access to the archive are as follows.

<A NAME="0011">How did this site begin?</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The current website is the adopted navigation template for direct contributions of save files that have been archived since as late as 2006. By that year, Iconoclast had organized such contributions for the Nintendo 64 in a thread-formatted archive. The first known collection of Nintendo 64 save files was once known as Dextrose, which had been known as the &quot;mother of all N64 knowledge&quot; since its activity in 1996, 10 years ago. Even after months of continued interest in adding to the newer but condensed 2006 archive by Iconoclast, the project ultimately stood no ground for being finished and was left in peace. It was not until 2009 that RetulAmora stumbled upon the emulation scene and, by the end of that year, generically proposed a system different from Iconoclast's condensed archive, flexibly supporting file requests and detailed contributions of save files. This is the system that has lived on through the continued interest of a single community for one year, leading to its organization on this website, ready to be shared with other communites interested in the collection.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="0100">Why do you put just one space after colons and sentence-ending punctuation?</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Historically, the standard taught most has been to have two spaces after colons and sentences. This is even taught to this very day in older keyboarding classes and was necessary for document processing using the typewriter because of the older monospace font type, in which all characters&mdash;even spaces&mdash;were the same number of pixels in boundary width, causing perfect alignment of symbols in sentences into congruent columns. By the time in which the roots of backward-compatible HTML specifications were first being defined from the origins of even earlier markup languages, the introduction of proportional font types, in which spacing between words is dynamically rendered, was well-known and officially gave birth to the modern typographic standard of having only one space after a period. This author continues to use two spaces after periods in most writings but not on this web page, as using two consecutive spaces in HTML requires seven bytes every time. There is highly continuous debate, even today, by many who were taught to always have two spaces after a period, but there are compilations of typographic studies showing that the use of two spaces after a period in proportional font types constitutes several degradations to readability rather than enforcements to it. Some of the text files with release notes for save files in this archive, in which Courier New is the default, monospace font, use two spaces after sentences and colons.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="0101">Why would I want to download save files?</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The purpose of the save files archive is to preserve someone's history with a game so that it can be accessed by somebody else, yet one who infrequently plays games or is not a passionate gamer might, under the need for accessing points in the game for a particular purpose, usually expect the availability of modifier codes to hack the game's memory and create the resulting changes of having a complete save instead of downloading somebody else's. Although this method is not always readily available for certain games and can cause conflicts due to the nature of modifier codes, it is a quick and easy method to simulate game completion to access specific points. By contrast, the data kept in a save file from playing through the game is not distorted from the effects of modifier codes and can contain a lot (in cases, megabytes) of data that the game reads from save storage that would be tedious to activate (even if they all are found to exist) using modifier codes. Non-cheating, less obvious purposes behind using somebody else's save file include inaccessibility of a previous save file one had completed, a master save file for multiple players to use so that data in regards to the game that they are sending is coincident (maybe synchronizing game play in an online environment), viewing somebody else's high scores or records or in-game profile from one of many possible ways the game could have been finished, using a hacked save file that increases compatibility with a virtual machine (or an emulator) environment, and other purposes that may be defined in the release notes for a save file that you can download.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="0110">How do I search for save files and download them?</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The index of the website lists all of the official symbols for video game platforms, which are assigned hyperlinks to the archive index of saves for that particular system. The organization of save files is consistent for every platform: There is a table column labeled &quot;Game&quot; (in reference to the official title of the game that the save file is for as a link to access that save file), a table column labeled &quot;Contributor&quot; (in reference to the one who published the save to be uploaded), a table column labeled &quot;Revision&quot; (in reference to the date of when a modification of the save file was last released by the publisher), a table column labeled &quot;File Format&quot; (in reference to the binary encoding or formatting of the save data that software needs to know to read it properly), a table column labeled &quot;Bytes&quot; (in reference to how large the save file is on most computers in the simplified byte unit of quantitative measurement), and a table column labeled &quot;Notes&quot; (in reference to the release notes for the save file as a link to access them).</BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="0111">How do I install save files?</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This is way too dependent on the hardware of the physical machine, but instructions on installing a save file to the hardware, if existent, can be accessed through a link at the bottom of the platform-specific archive index. Those less experienced might be using a virtual machine (an emulator of the physical machine) instead to play the game, which will access save files from a specified directory. Because many video game platforms are supported by an emulator, such instructions are usually not provided, with RetulAmora's instructions on installing save files to the Xbox 360 console being the initial exception. For a lot of older video game systems, save data is stored on a separate chip within the game cartridge, and special hardware is required for data access. For this reason, instructions on how to install a save file to a physical machine can be overly comprising of special information like the difficult task of obtaining such hardware and would be only useful basically to advanced users who already knew the information or already had the power to access it. There are still other ways that the save file can be installed for access by a computer (none of which being endorsed by site management), and there is already documentation supplied with utilities and virtual machines that can read the save data.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="1000">What kinds of file formats are the save files using?</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>There are many possible ways to encode save data, based on the physical machine on which the game is executed to access the save file data and the method through which the save file is used. To avoid endorsement of such methods, no information about software alternatives to support the save data will be specified here. The liability behind as to how the save file is used or any damage it causes or receives is the responsibility of the acquirer of the save file and not site management. Many save files, however, are small because they are encoded in a format directly usable by the physical machine, but some save files are much larger because they contain data that is not input to the physical machine as of its original product condition but may or may not be used by other systems. The primary example of this is a save state file, which is basically a memory image of an exact point in the game for which the save state was created to restore. Inputting the save state file should initialize the exact time and place within the game as specified in the complete game memory storage within the file.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="1001">Is the data here transferrable for use by different versions of the game released in other countries?</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Save data strictly native to the physical machine is almost always portable to a different version of the same game that was released in another country. Save states, however, contain a full memory definition image about the game and are way too sensitive to changes such as binary addressing offsets from revisions of a game for different countries to be compatible with even slightly-modified versions of the same published game. Unless specified otherwise in its release notes, a save file is published to support NTSC releases of the game (United States of America or Japan), even though the smaller files are generally transferrable. Save data written by the physical machine to a separate memory unit is also transferrable but headed by region-specific code that must be changed accordingly to load the save data on another version successfully.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="1010">How do I request a save to be added to the website?</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Find a way to contact a site management member who has access to a directory of the site pertinent to the system that the game was designed for. Some games are released for multiple physical machines, and the save format will vary in accordance to which system the game is loaded on. If there is specific criteria about the requested save data such as exactly how much progress or what area of progress should be made, then it should be specified in the request message. Since save files can be revised and reuploaded to the archive, asking for specific revisions to save files is also within reason provided that the request is sent to their original publishers.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="1011">How do I submit a save to the website?</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Either contact a site management member through the means as if requesting a save, or upload the file directly to the archive. The second option requires directory access to the archive of saves for the gaming system corresponding to the save to upload, which can be arranged for those interested. Some site management members may not have specified contact information, but any form of communication that will reach site management will do, even if it is public through a local website where they check. The author of the save file will be exactly as given in the channel of communication used to submit the save unless a certain name is requested. The revision date of the save file will be the date of its submittal unless a different date is preferred. The file format will be confirmed by a member of site management, and helpful information about the specifications behind the file format is encouraged in case this task is difficult. The release notes should in some way define a purpose of the save file but can discuss anything such as personal experiences with the game; it is most commonly released as a text file with the TXT file extension but can be in any format suitable as the contributor deems fit (as an example, a screenshot picture in PNG or GIF file format). <del>Fuck, make a PDF if you're that eccentric.</del></BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="1100">Must the save I submit complete everything in the game?</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The save submitted for upload to the website must have a purpose as suggested by the release notes. The discussed reasons as to why someone would want to download a save file are appropriate considerations for what qualifies a save file to be uploaded. The frequency of a save file completing every aspect of a game should be about the frequency of the preference to be thorough in one's work when contributing art, but considerations as to whether a submitted save file is appropriate to upload to the website are most certainly lenient and attentive to factors such as the use behind a partially completed save data file.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="1101">Can I submit a save for a game even if one already exists in the archive?</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Because there are multiple purposes of a game save file, a second save file when there was already a first may be added to the archive. A third and so forth is also acceptable to an extent, but every individual save file&mdash;even if they are all for the same game&mdash;is given detail by its own table row in the archive database. For database clarity, this trend should be minimized where feasible.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="1110">How do I revise or delete a save I submitted on the website?</A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Essentially as discussed on the requesting or submitting of a game save is an appropriate method to contact with concern of this. The privacy of the contributors is respected, so a save file must be removed on request.</BLOCKQUOTE>
