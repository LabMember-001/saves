Hello this is my very first PSX save and also one of the only PSX games I've
ever emulated. :) All I know is that this save state was created using the
"pSX" emulator.  Virtual Kasparov for the PSX does not save any form of
in-game progress, but it can use a memory card device to save played-out
games.  Instead this save state has everything set, track one song looped to
repeat on save state load, cursor on square a1 of the chess board in classic
2-D view for clarity, opening book disabled for software testing, and the
level set to Level 23 for maximal play quality (may take about 15 minutes per
move in many positions so feel free to reduce).
