I had trouble deciding whether to do the Shadow Temple or the Spirit temple first.  The shadow
temple is usually done first, but the Spirit Medallion appears before the shadow medallion on
your little medallion plaque.  In the end I chose the former.

After Killing Ricky Ricardo's ghost, I snagged the shadow medallion from the foul imp.

Impa that is.

Go!  Go to Gerudo valley!  Oh by the way I already did the "save the carpenters" thing, as
well as most of the training grounds.  There's just a couple rooms too, because you need
