as the coveted Spirit Medallion!

Then you headed for the Temple of Time, but not before completing the Gerudo's Training Course and getting
that Ice Arrow.  There, Sheikah was revealed to be..... Your mom!  I never saw that coming!  But (!!!) Your
mom was captured in a giant pink jewel and carried off to a castle! (not cliche at ALL)
