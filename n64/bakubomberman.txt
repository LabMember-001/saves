Here's a version of almost-completed save for Bomberman 64 that goes up to
having 99 out of the 100 total gold cards before unlocking Rainbow Palace.
This way, when you do defeat Altair and get the 5 gold cards from Stage 4
of Black Fortress, the one-time-only cinema for unlocking Rainbow Palace
will play.

I can't remember whether this file also works on the USA/Bomberman 64
version or not...too lazy to try it myself.  I just played the Japanese
version.  No idea how many months/years old this file is; I just wanted
it uploaded before I start wiping hard drives or something.

No cheat codes, cheats, or cheating used.
