I have 100 jigsaw pieces, which means physically I have only two left from
the ninety-eight I used to fill in all the pictures. This means all the
worlds are unlocked and finished and that Banjo has the double health bonus.

I also did the secret side of the game where the "Stop N Swop" mystery is
involved, where most people think you're supposed to get all six mystery eggs
and the ice key for something. Instead you get only the middle four and the
key, but the outer two are used to prevent cheating (or reading someone
else's debug notes about how to get the eggs yourself instead of learning
about it from what Banjo-Tooie was going to be before the 64DD got canceled).
