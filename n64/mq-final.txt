Same routine organizing the data here as with the prequel to this file,
mq-adult.sra.

File 1:  "Link"
  * Water Medallion collected
  * Spirit Temple solved, with Farore's Wind set to room above Twinrova sisters
  * Spirit Temple boss not defeated--do it yourself.
  * Gerudo Training Ground solved--Ice Arrows, Silver Gauntlets and Mirror
    Shield have all been collected.  Vast majority of heart pieces and
    skulltula tokens have been tracked down at this point, except for one
    skulltula I forgot to go back and kill in Hyrule Castle requiring time
    travel and the Song of Storms (and also except those requiring the ability
    to enter the Shadow Temple and so forth).
  * Link has 18 out of all 20 hearts and is missing no heart pieces, just the
    heart containers from the Spirit and Shadow Temple bosses.
File 2:  "Link"
  * Spirit Medallion collected
  * Shadow Temple solved, with Farore's Wind set to the room before Bongo Bongo
  * Shadow Temple boss not defeated--do it yourself.  Bongo Bongo reacts
    uniquely to its hands being struck by the Ice Arrow.  One hand is trying to
    punch open the rock-solid-frozen hand you just froze with the Ice Arrow,
    leaving the boss' head and main body immediately vulnerable.  This is
    another sign that the Spirit Temple isn't necessarily supposed to be
    completed after the Shadow Temple, even though it doesn't matter.
  * 99 skulltula tokens collected.  The 100th and last one that I left
    uncollected is the one outside Ganon's Castle, but if I got that for you
    then you wouldn't see the worthless cinema of Link discovering Ganon's
    Castle for the first time and dropping his jaw at the tower.
File 3:  "Link"
  * Shadow Medallion collected
  * Ganondorf's pissed at Zelda.
  * Zelda's pissed at the Sages.
  * The Sages are pissed at you (cause you're reading this file, not helping).
  * You're pissed at me (cause I took down the six barriers, entered the
    central tower to Ganon's Castle and left all the rest of the work to you).
  * Everybody's pissed.  Shut up and load the SRAM already and do something.
