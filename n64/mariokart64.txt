"Extra" engine difficulty unlocked.

All gold cups won for all cups in 50/100/150 cc and "Extra" engine races.

Course ghosts for Luigi Raceway, Mario Raceway, and Royal Raceway unlocked
within Time Trial mode.

You can tell by the record data that I had to have cheated to have finished
the races that fast.  Why I cheated:
1.  This was the only method to make the customized ghost racer impossible to
    render.  Now you have the option of focusing just on the internal game's
    course ghost of their three courses.
2.  My times would have sucked anyway.  If you're a pro, you wouldn't have
    fun racing with my ghosts.
3.  You can always reset the records and set the leading time to unlock the
    ghosts yourself, if you weren't looking for a convenience save.  I made
    good efforts near setting qualifying times by myself, but they were at
    least a second too late.  Feel free, anyone, to re-upload my save with
    fair times and well-earned records in the game data.
