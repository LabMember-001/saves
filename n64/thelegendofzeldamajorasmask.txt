If you think that save for this game on the official Project64 website is an
honest save file, you haven't seen this.  Unlike the one hosted at the PJ64
site I didn't cheat to make this. :P One way you can find this out is by
noticing that I also have the owl statues hit, the Bombers' Notebook is full,
and you don't see a heart piece sitting around in its opaque, to-be-collected
form in conjunction with having all 20 hearts. :D

I worked hard to thoroughly enjoy the saddest, most realistic game ever
released on the N64.
