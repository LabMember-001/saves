I remember getting this game from a friend, but I had a long road to
collecting all of the parts for the racing cars.  Even GameFAQs had a lot of
resources leaving blanks and mysteries as to how to unlock this or that.

Everything is played through, and all parts are in this A64 note export.  A64
files are imported into memory paks through N-Rage's DirectInput.  You can
also edit this file with a text editor to change the header around to match
the output of the versions of this game released in other countries if you
are playing the Japan or Europe version.
