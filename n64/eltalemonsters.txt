Unlike the USA and PAL/European versions of this game, the save format in the
Japanese version of Quest 64, "Eletale Monsters", uses some slightly different
formatting in the save file, so this save file won't load on the USA/PAL ROMs.

As much as this game sucks, they really did start to make progress in making
it realistic enough to play in the Japanese version.  They added more cinemas,
more special effects, more dialogues, and--would you believe it--made the
level-up and other stats accumulation go at a plausible rate.  Makes it kind
of halfway possible to get all 50 spirits of each of the 4 elements without
resorting to cheat codes (in USA/PAL versions it was just too damn infeasible).

Since N64 controller pak file can store up to 16 notes (2 pages each in this
game's case), I made full use of the MPK file to store a log of all progress.
The controller pak file therefore has no space left but who cares; just
bypass that warning every time ROM starts up.  Select any of the 16 saves.
