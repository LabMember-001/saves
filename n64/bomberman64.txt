Why 2 hours to beat the game in hard mode?  I was familiar enough to be
pretty quick (taking my time with Rainbow Palace), but the gold cards system
to me is not only boring but quite illustrative of the frustrating side of
the game.  I think it would have been better if only Rainbow Palace stages
had hard-to-find gold cards; instead they did things backwards. To get them
all I just hacked the RAM section storing which gold cards for which stages
are collected so that I had the first 100, finished Black Fortress, then
added the last twenty just before beating Rainbow Palace.  Everything else I
put up with the work in fair and square.

I tested myself with normal difficulty as well; having applied the RAM hack
for the gold cards here as well I finished everything else in 0 hours and 47
minutes.
