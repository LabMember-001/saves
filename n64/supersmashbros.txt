Here is a master save for SSB.  All stats or what record data particular to
your profile of having played the game are erased.  (If anyone really wants
to see my SSB64 stats I can just copy off the database on my N64 cart, but I
didn't repeat every attitude of fun in an emulator.)

What's important is that the following things are unlocked.
    New battle arena, "Mushroom Kingdom"
    Sound Test feature
    Item Switch feature
    Jigglypuff, Captain Falcon, Ness, and Luigi
